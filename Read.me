## 🌐 What Is Glitch?

Glitch is a browser-based platform that lets you **instantly build full-stack web apps**, remix other people's projects, and collaborate in real-time — all without needing to install anything on your computer.

Some of its coolest features:

- **Live editing**: See your changes instantly as you code.
- **Real-time collaboration**: Work with others like you would on Google Docs.
- **Remixable projects**: Start with a template or someone else's app and build on top of it.
- **Free hosting**: No need to worry about servers or deployment pipelines.
- **Great for learning**: It's beginner-friendly, with tons of open-source examples.
